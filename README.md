==============

**NOTICE: This project has been abandoned because it uses SDL and I'm getting into SFML, I'm going to make a new platformer game instead; this is going to exist only for historical purposes.**

An SDL top-down puzzled shooter game written in C++, focusing on physics and realism and stuff.
It will generate maps by itself and although, I still don't have any storyline. You'll be able to pick stuff up and hit people with them, and stuff like that. Please make 
an issue up there (^) if you want any features! This is my first game that isn't tic-tac-toe, so it'll be helpful for *any* feedback, just `/msg Nahiyan` on 
[Freenode!](https://https://freenode.net/)
